Blender To Environment Helper


Im too lazy to make a readme, frankly because its too simple to not undertstand unless your not using the actual program to switch models to a custom env to properly.


This is just a repo that contains all of the environments in a blender file, this may or may not help others with accurate placement of custom environments.

Only thing you need to hide the players place before exporting, the players place lets you know where the player is facing in the environment, but you can also just go off the environment.

No need to export with the environment hidden/deleted, its broken, and for a reason, it will not show up in your final model. If in future versions the environment comes with the model, please make an issue report.


Other:


Make sure Global Orientation is: Foward: Z , and Up: Y. This makes sure these are in sync with the Global Orientation inside BeatSaber.
